Building
-------------------

Depends on the unittest-cpp framework: [Installation instructions](https://github.com/unittest-cpp/unittest-cpp/wiki/Building-Using-CMake)

    mkdir build
    cd build && cmake ..
    make
    ./main

Tests
-------------------

A set of sanity tests in `test/tests.cpp` are setup to run on the default target `main`, and can be used in development.

Autogenerated tests for the heuristics can be created by the tools in `gen_tests`:

    cd gen_tests
    ./gen_tests.sh

this reads the `test_config.txt` file and autogenerates unittest-cpp tests for each graph with bounds found.
The graphs are encoded in the [graph6 format](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/data/formats.txt) and are (manually) retrieved from the [ToTo treewidth database](https://treedecompositions.com/#) along with the graphs upper and lower bounds on treewidth (verified as exact solutions or verified as best upper/lower bounds by other users).

To get the graph6 string from a chosen graph in the database, it can be retrieved it from the URL itself - e.g., `https://treedecompositions.com/#/graph/FrSXg`, where the graph6 string is `FrSXg` - or by using the database query to return up to 15 graphs and exporting them to a csv file. This can be further converted to a `test_config` file by using the conf_from_csv.py tool:

    python3 conf_from_csv.py Overview.csv test_config.txt

The current tests in the config are mix of graphs with high bounds gap with an increasing number of vertices.

After the tests are generated, they can be run with the `heurisitc_tests` target:

    mkdir build
    cd build && cmake ..
    make
    ./heurisitc_tests
